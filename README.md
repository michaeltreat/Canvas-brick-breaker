# Canvas Brick Breaker Game
Some of the students I am working with are making a "breakout" style game. I am using this to test out the Canvas api to see how it works.

Test out what I have so far here : https://michaeltreat.github.io/HTML_Canvas_Breakout_Testing/
Click on each graph to pause and un pause the game!
